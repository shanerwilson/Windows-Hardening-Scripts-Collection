## Overview

Welcome to the **Windows Hardening Scripts Collection** â€” a curated set of PowerShell scripts designed to help detect, mitigate, and prevent common Windows security risks and attack vectors.

These scripts focus on key areas including:  
- WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) monitoring and hardening  
- Startup and persistence point detection  
- Registry autorun analysis  
- Suspicious service detection  
- And more...

Each script is modular and self-contained, making it easy to run individual checks or combine them into larger automation workflows.

## Why Use These Scripts?

Windows environments are a common target for attackers leveraging persistence and lateral movement techniques. This repository empowers security professionals, system administrators, and auditors to:

- Identify potential compromises early  
- Enforce best practices for system hardening  
- Automate routine security audits  
- Increase visibility into suspicious activity  

---

Each folder contains the PowerShell script and a dedicated README explaining:  
- Purpose and functionality  
- How to run the script  
- Interpretation of results  
- Additional notes
