## Overview

Welcome to the **Windows Hardening Scripts Collection** â€” a curated set of PowerShell scripts designed to help detect, mitigate, and prevent common Windows security risks and attack vectors.

These scripts focus on key areas including:  
- WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) monitoring and hardening  
- Startup and persistence point detection  
- Registry autorun analysis  
- Suspicious service detection  
- And more...

Each script is modular and self-contained, making it easy to run individual checks or combine them into larger automation workflows.
